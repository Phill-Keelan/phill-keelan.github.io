    <h1>Foundations reflection</h1>
    <p>
      I never would have thought that a software development course would put so
      much emphasis on human skills. I thought software developers were nerds
      working in a basement somewhere. Oh how I was wrong...
    </p>
    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I can honestly say I haven't learnt much during the Human Skills aspect.
      Understanding this was something I needed in the military to become an
      effective leader. The military puts a lot of emphasis on human skills
      including self-realisation and growth mindset during their leadership
      training.
    </p>

    <p>
      One thing that I learnt was telling myself to "get better thoughts" when
      I'm feeling anxious or frustrated. This simple act allows me to focus on
      being nice to myself by telling myself the situation is better than I'm
      thinking.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Values: tend to be the things that drive an individual. These are
      typically unwavering or non-negotiable. When working with others it helps
      to understand these others values so that you may shape your intentions to
      match their values.
    </p>

    <p>
      Empathy: is your ability to understand what others are feeling.
      Understanding this allows you to shape your intent to enable others to
      feel valued and increase their productivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Self-awareness: Is your own ability to know who you are. This is a hugely
      important aspect. Without knowing your weaknesses you limit your own
      growth. Understanding you weaknesses enables you to create prompts to
      address them when required and allow you to turn them towards your
      strengths.
    </p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>

    <p>
      The thing that surprised me the most was how much emphasis is placed on
      the Human Skills aspect on this course. I always thought software
      developers were reclusive individuals so it was surprising to find out
      that is definitely not the case. But it also makes a lot of sense
      considering most projects require small teams to work together to create
      them
    </p>

    <h2>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I think that for each individual that conducts any type of self reflection
      it can be very confronting and I understand that some people would want to
      shy away from this. But at some point we have to realise that we are only
      confronting ourselves. And if we can't survive through our own
      self-criticism them how are we going to accept criticism from others in
      order to allow growth
    </p>

    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>

    <p>I believe this is a focus for a number of reasons. Mainly:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        1. Learning programming is like learning a new language and can be quite
        a hard task. Human skills helps by promoting a growth mindset which
        increases the likelihood that students will pass the course.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Programmers work in teams to create. So we must learn how to work in
        a team. Furthermore we will likely need to work with other teams.
        Employers will be looking for people who can play nicely with others.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer
    </h2>

    <p>
      I think it's awesome that there is an emphasis on human skills. Everyone
      should learn some form of human skills for their own personal growth
      despite the industry you intend to work in
