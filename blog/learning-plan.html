    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

    <p>
      Throughout history civilisations have continued to evolve. Those who
      evolve with it thrive and those who do not will get left behind. Take John
      Deere for example. John Deere was born in 1804, the same year the
      locomotive was created. He witnessed the locomotives growth through the
      years and identified areas that could use this same system where he could
      capitalise its abilities. In 1837 John Deere created the first
      self-scouring steel plow. His legacy grew from there.

    <p>
      So too have I seen the growth of the internet and the "age of information"
      and its transition into the "age of intelligence".
    </p>

    <h2>Long Term Pathway</h2>

    <p>
      Earlier this year I decided to join the army but the corps was not willing
      to let me leave so easily. It would seem that I had developed an
      interesting and very niche set of skills over the years that make it hard
      for me to just leave. Because of this I decided to create a system to
      replace people with my skills and increase battlefield survivability.
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>

    <p>
      When it comes to learning I love to explore new ideas. This allows me to
      find out why things work and identify the algorithms. However, this also
      can prove a pitfall as I tend to end up down rabbit holes and soak up more
      time than necessary. Because of this I am sicking to the time-box as best
      I can when conducting the lessons but creating a note to follow up on
      information outside of these lessons.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills I'd like to develop</h2>

    <p>
      I tend to approach each learning experience with and open mind. I would
      like to stick to the time box suggestions and stay out of the rabbit holes
      ass much as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Commitments</h2>

    <p>
      I would like to make a commitment to my peers that I will push to
      understand them and where their thought processes stem from. This should
      help us flow better during group learning sessions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would like to make a commitment to my peers and facilitators that I will
      reach out for help when I am stuck and that I will do my best to assist my
      peers when they are stuck. I will try to understand and solve the problem
      by myself for 15min. I will then search the internet for 5 min before
      reaching out on Discord.
    </p>

    <h2>Scheduling Issues</h2>

    <p>
      My partner works early mornings and doesn't finish until 1pm so I am stuck
      with school drop offs which allows me to start studying at 0900 weekdays.
