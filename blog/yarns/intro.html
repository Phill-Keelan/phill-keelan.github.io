    <h1>Initial Yarn</h1>

    <p>
      8 years into my career in the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment I find
      myself standing in the guard hut at ISAF HQ in the "Green Zone" of Kabul,
      Afghanistan. We had been on the ground less than two hours and already we
      had navigated through the city despite the Improvised Explosive Device
      (IED) threats we were warned of moments after we landed. Now, in this
      cramped little hut, three of us who had just landed were standing behind
      our team leader while he tries to explain the details of our arrival to
      the Italian Military Police (MP) Officer in charge of security. The MP
      feels threatened and reaches for his pistol...I reach for mine. Is this
      really how my first visit to Afghanistan is supposed to start? I'm
      supposed to kill this Italian MP so that he doesn't kill my friends? Am I
      really going to start an international incident? If it means my friends
      are safe then yes...
    </p>
    <p>
      Kia ora, I'm Phill Keelan and after 19 years in the Royal New Zealand
      Infantry Regiment it's time for a change of pace and a change in career.
      Luckily, no one was hurt in the guard hut that day. But the MP did feel a
      bit embarrassed from that day forward. This was not the first sticky
      situation in my career and it sure as hell wasn't the last. Such is the
      nature of being in the infantry.
    </p>
    <h2>Ethical Decisions</h2>
    <p>
      There are still some people who do not like those of us within the
      infantry. They think that we are war mongers. I've even been called a
      "baby killer" to my face. But we don't get to pick where our government
      sends us. We can only choose to go or not. And we go to protect our
      friends who also go. The question I would ask others who query why I would
      choose to go is "if not me then who?". I'm good at what I do and believe I
      have the skills and knowledge to ensure I come home. But if I don't go
      then someone else has to. Someone else's son/daughter, brother/sister,
      father/mother. Will they fair better than I would? Can I bear to subject
      their families to that loss should the worse happens? And so I go...
    </p>
    <h2>Cultural Values</h2>
    <p>
      The mƒÅori people are a fierce battle hardened people. This was showcased
      to the world throughout the New Zealand Wars as well as World War One and
      Two. This paired with a strict and somewhat violent upbringing made
      joining the infantry seem like natural progression. Yet with all the
      violence I saw throughout the world and all the pain and suffering it
      caused there was a shift in my mindset. The drive to enact violence had
      been put in a dormant state and a sense of "manaakitanga ki tatou
      rangatira" had been brought to the forefront. And so my values changed. So
      too did the journey.
    </p>
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p>
      For personal development reasons I have conducted the Myer's Briggs
      Personality Test several times throughout the years and always end up as
      the Logician. The Logician's strengths include being analytical and
      curious. These two traits have stuck with me through my career and have
      helped thrive through continuously learning and easily developing new
      skills. These will help me learn software development through the analysis
      of what is being taught, creating problems through being curious, then
      problem solving through analytical thinking.
    </p>
    <h2>Pitfalls</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the Logician comes with its pitfalls as every personality
      does. As a logician empathy is not a strength of mine. This was also
      confirmed through a Hogan's test I done as part of some leadership
      development I conducted. Because I was able to identify this flaw through
      the Hogan's test I was able to create prompts to ensure the I am more
      empathetic to my friends and colleagues so I feel this is no longer a
      problem. However, the analytical trait can diminish response times and so
      the conversation sometimes moves on before an ideal answer comes to mind.
      Because of this I may struggle to keep up in a structure learning
      environment but this will not be a problem in a flipped classroom.
    </p>
    <h2>Working With Others</h2>
    <p>
      Being in the infantry isn't always the excitement of near death
      experiences. Ninety percent of the time it's boring and monotonous. Like
      with every job you're not going to get along or see eye to eye with
      everyone. So being able to communicate effectively becomes a big aspect of
      the job. One of the last positions I was in was the Sniper Supervisor for
      the 2nd/1st Battalion in Burnham Military Camp. My role was to be the
      centre of all sniper matters within the battalion. Because of the
      qualifications required for the position no one else could do my job and
      so no one could tell me how to do my job. However, snipers are the only
      thing in an infantry battalion and so there is always resistance and
      tension from other capabilities. Despite these tensions the capabilities
      nee to learn how to support each other. One is nothing without the other
      and compromise is key. In saying that, sometimes "No" is acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One example of how I dealt with resistance when working with others was
      when a senior member (two ranks higher than me) was trying to tell me what
      my snipers were doing during an attack (exercise). I explained to him that
      that's not in their job description but he was persistent that he does not
      care and the snipers were going to do it anyway because the Commanding
      Officer needs every aspect that he explained. I identified an alternate
      way which meant I had to do more work but my snipers could focus on doing
      what they're trained to and, reluctantly, he was happy with that. I then
      gritted my teeth, walked away, and actioned what I said it would. Even now
      this I can see that this was the best of the worst outcomes. The benefit
      being that my lads weren't used ineffectively and so they were able to
      maintain their job satisfaction. The trade off of creating more work for
      myself in that moment was appreciated by the snipers in turn making my
      life easier later on down the track.
