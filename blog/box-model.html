    <h1>Keez Box Model</h1>
    <p>
      When I first learnt about margin, border, and padding it was on
      freecodecamp while working through the Basic CSS module. Even after
      building a Caf√© Menu and a Set of Coloured Markers I still wasn't sure
      which was which. Then I moved onto learning on DevAcademy Foundations and
      it clicked. It is similar to creating a word document where the Margin is
      the outside space around the page, the border is a border you can put
      around the outside of your writing/content, while the padding is the space
      between the border and the writing/content. I don't know why this was so
      difficult to understand during freecodecamp. Likely because it was easier
      to just read the hints. Anyway let's go through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a word document the margin can be set by sliding the dark space on the
      ruler at the top and to the left of the document screen. A border is set
      on the inside of the inside of the margin when a border is added to which
      you can format its thickness, colour and style. And padding is created by
      dragging the arrows along the ruler at the top and left of the document
      screen.

    <img
      id="box-model-word"
      src="../../img/box-model-word-doc.jpg"
      alt="Box Model Word Screenshot"
    />
    <p>
      When coding these we can create the content as an html and change it's
      margin, border and padding through through CSS.
    </p>
    <p>To replicate the word doc we can create the content as.</p>
    <img
      id="box-model-html"
      src="../../img/box-model-html.jpg"
      alt="Box Model HTML Screenshot"
    />
    <p>
      Then add lines to the CSS sheet to style the margin, border, and padding
    </p>
    <img
      id="box-model-css"
      src="../../img/box-model-css.jpg"
      alt="Box Model CSS Screenshot"
    />

    <p>This is literally written in this page below...</p>

    <div id="box-model">
      <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p>
      <img
        id="horse-and-dog"
        src="../../img/horse-and-dog.jpg"
        alt="Horse and Dog"
      />
      <p>
        How may wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>I hope this helps! Happy coding!</p>
