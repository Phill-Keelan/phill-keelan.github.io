    <h1>Te Whare Mauri Ora</h1>

    <p>
      Awhile back, after spending too long in dark places, it was time to
      reshape my head and give back to my community. It was time to stop
      focusing on how I could hurt people and instead devote my time to helping
      others thrive. And so a charitable trust called Kaiārahi Rapuara was
      created.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the founding ideas for Kaiārahi Rapuara was that of wellbeing. "How
      can someone learn something else if they do not know themselves?". Te
      Whare Tapa Whā was initially the basis for this, however, we switched to
      Te Whare Mauri Ora after sitting down with Wiremu Gray and discussing the
      shortfalls we found with Sir Mason Durie's Te Whare Tapa Whā.
    </p>

    <p>
      For everyones understanding we will approach this wellbeing plan using Sir
      Mason Durie's Te Whare Tapa Wha model for wellbeing.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      Words are powerful things. Thanks to the confirmation-bias your brain will
      reinforce everything it hear. Regardless of whether it is a truth or a lie
      your brain will find opportunities to make it true. So if someone calls
      you "useless" and you do not correct it then it will make this the truth.
    </p>

    <img
      class="code-screenshot"
      id="useless-true"
      src="../img/useless-true.png"
      alt="let useless = false let false = true"
    />

    <p>
      So because we know this to be not true we need to change the syntax to our
      thinking.
    </p>

    <img
      class="code-screenshot"
      id="awesome-true"
      src="../img/awesome-true.png"
      alt="let useless = false let awesome = true"
    />
    <p>
      Welcome to the confidence boost you so deserve and bring on the future.
