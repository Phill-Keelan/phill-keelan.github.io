    <h1>Javascript</h1>

    <h2>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h2>

    <p>
      If you were to visit a restaurant you would be greeted by a waiter and
      lead to your table where you would sit in the mixed aroma of food coming
      from the kitchen. If I were to describe to a friend the relationship
      between HTML, CSS and JavaScript I would use a restaurant. HTML is all the
      content. The tables, chairs, menu's, cutlery, cups etc. All the things
      that you would expect to see in a restaurant. CSS is the style. From the
      over all theme of the restaurant to the individual napkins or salt and
      pepper shakers. Javascript is the owner, the Ma√Ætre D and the Chef. They
      can change the style, the layout, the content, the food, the smell,
    </p>

    <h2>Control Flow</h2>

    <p>
      Control flow is the order which the code is executed. This is usually done
      from top to bottom of the page unless there are things such as loops or
      conditionals. Control flow allows actions to happen in a sequential order.
    </p>

    <ul>
      Control Flow Example:
    </ul>
    <li>Wake up</li>
    <li>Go to the toilet</li>
    <li>Wash hands</li>
    <li>Have breakfast</li>
    <li>Do dishes</li>
    <li>Brush teeth</li>
    <li>Go to work</li>

    <h2>Loops</h2>

    <p>
      A loop, much like it's name describes, is an action that cycles over and
      over again until the parameters are met. An easy example for loop is the
      while loop. Below is an example of this.
    </p>

    <p>Loop Example</p>

    <img
      class="code-screenshot"
      id="loop-example"
      src="../../img/loop-example.png"
      alt="while (Dancing != lonerDanceParty) {
        queenDontStopMeNow(Dancing)
      }"
    />

    <p>
      This code will check wether you are dancing. If you aren't, it will play
      "Queen - Don't Stop Me Now" until you are having a loner dance party lol
    </p>

    <h2>DOM</h2>

    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is a hierarchal representation of each
      aspect of a webpage. Each object or node on the hierarchal structure is
      represented to allow easy manipulation.
    </p>

    <p>Interacting with the DOM can be done using Javascript</p>

    <h2>Arrays vs Objects</h2>

    <p>
      We use Objects when we have one thing with multiple properties. We use
      Arrays when we have multiple thing
    </p>

    <p>
      For example if we want to create something (an object) with multiple
      properties such as a person we could use
    </p>

    <img
      class="code-screenshot"
      id="object-example"
      src="../../img/object-example.png"
      alt="let person1 = {
        firstName: 'John',
        middleName: 'Jacob Jinglheimer',
        lastName: 'Schmidt',
      }"
    />

    <p>
      However, if we want to create a list of objects (an array) we would use
    </p>

    <img
      class="code-screenshot"
      id="array-example"
      src="../../img/array-example.png"
      alt="let names = ['John', 'jacob', 'jingleheimer', 'Schmidt']"
    />

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p>
      Functions are a means of creating a reaction to an action. For instance if
      you had a "button" you could generate a function that thanks the user for
      clicking the button.
