    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is a persons ability to identify, understand and
      manage situations involving there own and/or someone else's emotions and
      how they will effect the situation.
    </p>

    <h2>Emotional Quotient (EQ) vs Intelligence Quotient (IQ)</h2>

    <p>
      IQ is your ability to understand the problem as it is. EQ is your ability
      to understand how solving the problem will affect those nvolved.Let's
      simplify a well known conflict, the Battle of Troy. In this story Paris,
      son of the Trojan King, ran off with Helen, the wife of Menelaus whose
      brother was the great commander Agamemnon. Imagine ourself as the
      King/Queen of Troy
    </p>

    <p>
      Problem: Youngest son returns home with another man's wife. Her husband's
      brother will bring an army to fetch her.
    </p>

    <p>
      IQ Answer: Return the girl and let Paris be killed by the hand of
      Menelaus. Prevent a war that will soak up 10 years of energy and
      resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      EQ Response: Paris will be dead and Helen will be miserable for the rest
      of her days. You, as the king/queen will need to bury and grieve over your
      son's death. Civil unrest in the kingdom due to the people believing you
      gave up your son to protect yourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q Response: We need to protect our loved ones. The walls will hold off the
      greek attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outcome: To protect the ones you love you decide to fight confident that
      you can defend against the Greek forces.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>

    <p>
      It is important to understand EQ so that you may thrive in society through
      understanding all elements external to the physical. You can appreciate
      you're own thoughts and feelings as well as those of others whether they
      be close friends or passersby.
