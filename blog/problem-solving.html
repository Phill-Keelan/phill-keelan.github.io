    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <p>
      My brain craves stimulation! If events aren't meaningful or challenging it
      is very hard for me to stay focused. I find myself getting bored and
      allowing myself to become distracted. For this reason my brain really
      enjoys finding patterns and solving problems
    </p>

    <h2>Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>

    <p>
      During the JavaScript Kata 2: Manipulating objects challenge I learnt a
      lot of basic syntax. In my head I was thinking it was going to get more
      and more difficult so when I got down to the final question (question 11)
      I figured it was gonna be super complicated. I started writing out this
      elaborate code to pull properties from one object and place it in another.
      But I just could not get it to work. So I stood up and walked away.
      Pouring over some old notes later on I found the answer to question could
      be so simple but I was in disbelief that it would work. Decided to try it
      anyway...lo and behold it worked...face palm...lol
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried to google the solution but my prompts were too elaborate trying to
      explain to much to google. I tried the rubber ducky method by talking it
      through with my dog. I tried copilot but I didn't understand what it was
      trying to tell me. I felt myself getting heated so it was time for a break
      and I decided to get up and clear my head. Through this experience I
      learnt to keep it simple.
    </p>

    <h2>Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>

    <p>
      I was a little lost when I first read question 6 of the Gradebook
      Challenge. I decided to take a step back and change my approach. Up until
      this point I had been googling a lot and using co-pilot to explain things
      to me. This time I decided to write out everything in a hierarchal fashion
      on a notepad so that I could understand where everything was. I was then
      able to clearly see how the syntax should be written.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>

    <p>
      Pseudocode: I guess I kinda used pseudocode to solve Gradebook question 6.
      In a roundabout way. I would like to better use this to see how effective
      it is for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Try something: Again, I kinda used this for Manipulating Objects question
      11 when I just tried what I had thought. But this method doesn't yield
      results fast enough
    </p>

    <p>
      Rubber Ducky Method: I just enjoyed talking to my dog lol. Didn't
      necessarily help during this challenge
    </p>

    <p>
      Reading error messages: These helped only when I could understand them
    </p>

    <p>
      Asking for help: Because of the large time boxes for these activities I
      never felt the need to ask for help. Instead I favoured searching to
      understand as long as I could stay in the time box.
    </p>

    <h2>Asking for Help</h2>

    <p>
      The JavaScript Kata time boxes allow for extensive exploration of
      different avenues to find the answers without the need to ask for help.
      Because of this I didn't feel I needed to ask for help
    </p>

    <p>
      That's a lie...there was a time where I should've just asked for help but
      I didn't until after I had already finished the challenge This was about
      how to read console.log in VS Code. Knowing this at the start may have
      made the Kata experience a little easier...maybe.
