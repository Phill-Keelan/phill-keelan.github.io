    <h1>Neurolasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h2>Benefits of Neuroplasticity</h2>

    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is defined as the ability of the nervous system to change
      its activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing
      its structure, functions, or connections after injuries, such as a stroke
      or traumatic brain injury (TBI)
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the above is the definition, according to the US National
      Institute of Health, it isn't limited to recovery from brain injuries.
      Understanding that the brain has this ability is the key to unlocking your
      learning potential.
    </p>

    <p>
      The basic idea is that with proper training we can develop new
      neurological pathways. More that that is the more you use these neural
      pathways the more they become the default path. This can be illustrated
      much like a path through the woods, the more you walk it the more you walk
      it the more definitive the path will become.
    </p>

    <h2>Increase Neuroplasticity</h2>

    <p>
      It is documented that creative and/or algorithmic activities can increase
      neuroplasticity. [Assumption: these activities allow critical thinking and
      problem solving to take place which actually stimulates the brain].
      Another group of studies found that physically taxing activities can
      improve brain health and delay the onset of degenerative brain illnesses
    </p>

    <h2>Solve for Happy</h2>

    <p>
      A particularly interesting video, while not directly linked to
      neuroplasticity, was the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc24RCmvlTU"
        >"Solve for Happy"</a
      >
      lecture by Mo Gawdat. He doesn't directly talk about neuroplasticity,
      however, he does discuss the idea of creating healthy habits for a happier
      life
    </p>

    <h2>What is Growth Mindset</h2>

    <p>
      A Growth Mindset fit hand in hand with the idea of neuroplasticity. A
      growth mindset is about approaching every challenge and every failure as
      an opportunity for learning. This is opposite to the Fixed Mindset in
      which a person thinks that talent and knowledge are fixed attributes.
      Understanding and employing a growth mindset leads to exponential growth
    </p>

    <h2>Yes Man</h2>

    <p>
      An interesting movie that highlights a growth mindset, unbeknown to most
      people who have watched it, is
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDh1l3qVNoY">"Yes Man"</a>. This
      quirky comedy starring funny man Jim Carrey sees the main character enter
      the movie saying no to everything and doesn't even tr. Until one day he
      attends a seminar in which he feels he is singled out and has to say yes
      to everything thereafter or something bad will happen. Fast forward 10 or
      so minutes and some events solidify the belief that he will be in peril if
      he says no to anything. And so the he starts saying yes. Low and behold
      his life improves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is that when he says no to everything in the beginning he is
      displaying a closed mindset. He thinks his life is what it is and has
      stopped trying. After saying yes to everything he starts learning new
      things and experiencing new experiences. All these new activities increase
      his confidence and he is less apprehensive to give the next activity ago.
      He has ow shifted to having a growth mindset.
