        <h3>Latest Blog - Culture</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout history civilisations have continued to evolve. Those who
          evolve with it thrive and those who do not will get left behind. Take
          John Deere for example. John Deere was born in 1804, the same year the
          locomotive was created. He witnessed the locomotives growth through
          the years and identified areas that could use this same system where
          he could capitalise its abilities. In 1837 John Deere created the
          first self-scouring steel plow. His legacy grew from there.
